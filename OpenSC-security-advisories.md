* 30.05.2023 A security flaw in the pkcs15 cardos_have_verifyrc_package function allows an attacker to supply a malformed ASN1 context, potentially causing a heap-based buffer out-of-bounds read, information leak, or further damage [CVE-2023-2977](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p22r-5f28-437x)
* 20.10.2021 Multiple issues have been identified in OpenSC, including heap double free, use after free/return, and buffer overflows. They can be triggered by malicious smartcards sending malformed responses to APDU commands. Coded as ([CVE-2021-42778](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-4277), [CVE-2021-42779](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-42779), [CVE-2021-42780](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-42780) and [CVE-2021-42781](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-42782))
* 24.11.2020 Heap buffer overflows have been detected in the smart card drivers for oberthur, TCOS and Gemsafe GPK, which can be triggered by a specially crafted smart card during the initialization of OpenSC ([CVE-2020-26570](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-26570), [CVE-2020-26571](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-26571) and [CVE-2020-26572](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-26572))
* [13.09.2018](https://sourceforge.net/p/opensc/mailman/message/36414448/) Multiple issues have been identified in OpenSC, ranging from stack based buffer overflows to out of bounds reads and writes on the heap.
